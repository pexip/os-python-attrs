Description: Attributes without boilerplate (Python 2)
 attrs is an MIT-licensed Python package with class decorators that ease the
 chores of implementing the most common attribute-related object protocols.
 .
 You just specify the attributes to work with and attrs gives you:
   - a nice human-readable __repr__,
   - a complete set of comparison methods,
   - an initializer,
   - and much more
 without writing dull boilerplate code again and again.
 .
 This package contains attrs packaged for Python 2.
